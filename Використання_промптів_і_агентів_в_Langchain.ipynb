      "2. **Calculating Growth Rates**:\n",
      "   - From 2021 to 2022: (190 - 200) / 200 = -0.05 (a decrease of 5%)\n",
      "   - From 2022 to 2023: (210 - 190) / 190 = 0.1053 (an increase of approximately 10.53%)\n",

      "3. **Average Growth Rate**:\n",
      "   - Average growth rate = (-0.05 + 0.1053 + 0.0476) / 3 = 0.0343 (approximately 3.43%)\n",

      "4. **Estimating Exports for 2025**:\n",

Overall, the value of exported oranges decreased by an average -9% for all suppliers since 2020 when shipments of oranges were worth $5.64 billion. The flow of oranges was slower this week, due to the rain and the drop in temperatures in the South and Southeast. However, as activities in the industrial segment continue at a rapid pace, there were no major changes in values in the table market. Similarly, as the demand for oranges increases, more people want oranges than there are oranges available for them to buy. As a result, the price will rise until demand meets supply again. FrutPlanet will help you understand these variations. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been forced to suspend the launch of it‚Äôs controversial ‚ÄòPandemic Treaty‚Äò due to pushback from millions of citizens who are demanding justice for the crimes perpetrated by the globalist elite during the pandemic. \"That generates demand for good overseas lemons.

While the total value of exported oranges decreased by an average of 9% since 2020, there is an indication that demand is increasing, leading to a situation where more people want oranges than are available.
